# What will attendees learn?

Participants will understand the overall process of threat intelligence in incident response, cyber security and other fields. They will be able to create their own intelligence and share it efficiently with other partners. They will be able to analyse specific requirements of information sharing communities and apply it to their day-to-day operational activities. Participants will be able to apply the information sharing concepts and improve their cyber security processes to gather more information and exercise it more efficiently.
